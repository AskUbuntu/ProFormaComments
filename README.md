## Pro Forma Comments

[![Pro Forma Continuous Integration Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/AskUbuntu/ProFormaComments.png)](https://travis-ci.org/AskUbuntu/ProFormaComments)

This repository exists to simplify the process of maintaining a list of frequently used comments for posting on Ask Ubuntu questions. This is done by adding our special URL to [this userscript](http://stackapps.com/questions/2116/autoreviewcomments-pro-forma-comments-for-se).

### Instructions

Add the following URL as a remote source:

> https://raw.github.com/askubuntu/ProFormaComments/master/comments.jsonp

### History

We had a problem over on [Ask Ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com).

We had a bunch of "stock" comments that we used, as part of keeping the site running smoothly. More or less, what we did was use the Pro Forma Script and then store our community suggested comments within [this answer on Meta.AU](http://meta.askubuntu.com/q/1323/6005).

As you can imagine, this became a problem. The Pro Forma Script linked above now has support for remote sources - so this Git repo is where we're storing them.
